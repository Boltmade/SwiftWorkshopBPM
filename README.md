# Writing iOS Apps with Swift

This is a small demo application to get you started using some of the features of Swift. The application lets you tap a beat on the screen and see the average beats per minute you are tapping. This can be used to find the tempo of songs by tapping along.

The intended use of this repository is for workshop participants to check their solutions to the steps as we work (if desired), skip a step if they get stuck and want to move on, or to have a guide to continue working on steps after we run out of time.

We do not recommend going through the following steps before the workshop: you can, but then you will be bored during the workshop :)

Here are the tags corresponding to each step:
